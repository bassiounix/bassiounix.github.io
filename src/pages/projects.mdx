  <ProjectCard
    title="Interpreter"
    desc="Built tree-walk interpreter for Lox programming language. Developed compiler frontend with custom tokenizer and parser to produce parse tree (Abstract Syntax Tree). Implemented parse tree code generation for statements and expressions using code generator and visitor pattern. Built interpreter backend with context-aware execution using parse tree interpretation with error reporting for compile-time and runtime errors."
